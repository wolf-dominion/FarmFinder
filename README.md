Farm Finder - a CLI application by Hannah Drury and Lydia Gregory.

About Farm Finder:

About the App
Farm Finder is a CLI application that allows the user to easily find local farms in their area and see what they have currently available.
It was created as a tool to supprt local food economies by allowing users to easily find the information to order food driectly from farmers themselves.

About the Data
We built the app to eventually be compatible with the Local Harvest API which has data for small farms all over the country. Unfortunately, the API is not publicly available but we are talking with Local Harvest now for permission to use there data. For now, weâ€™ve hand-seeded a few examples of farms in the denver area.

What We Learned
1. We learned how to integrate a tty-prompt ruby gem menu display with an enumerble to create a dynamic application. Data can be added and updated without having to rewrite any code in the program.
2. We learned how to *successfully* push/pull from Github, merge conflicts, and create new branches.
3. This project was both of our first attempts at pair programming. This experience helped us learn how to communicate our code and our ideas, and combine two project visions into one.
